Project description:

a)I implemented two classes named circle and triangle in order to draw their respective shapes.
Using these classes I have implemented an geometric design.

b)I have overloaded the output operator for circle class to print the circle info without using the get method
and additionally have overloaded the output operator for trianlge class to perform draw operation.

The easiest part of this project:
Operator overloading and its usage.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
Filling colors to shapes which are not rectangle.
